#summary Installation

= Setting up =


== Requirements: ==


  * Linux server (may or may not work with other OS's)
  * Apache
  * PHP5 + mbstring + XML
  * pear package MDB2 + database spesific driver
  * PostgreSQL (or Mysql)

== Setting database ==

  * you must create a database for IDA:
    ** mysql: create database _your_databasename_ DEFAULT character set utf8
    ** postgresql: createdb _your_databasename_

== Installation from SVN ==
By using symlinks one can update the code without deleting config-settings.

  * first checkout the code from svn:
  http://code.google.com/p/idaframework/source/checkout

  * make a new directory in your server document root (for example idadev_test)
  * symlink server-directory from /idaframerwork-read-only/idacore/ under idadev.

/YOUR_SERVERROOT/idadev_test/server/

  * copy config.php to idadev_test/


== config.php==
Edit /idadev_test/config.php and define:
  * database name
  * database user
  * database password 
  * databasetype (mysql/psql)

Be careful when editing config.php, since it must be a valid php file!

== Setup ==
Now everything should be ready and setup can be launched:

- Aim your browser to /idacore/server/init/

First page tests things and if everything seems to OK, then just proceed. In ideal case, you should end up to the introduction page.

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------------------------------------------

Q: I'm not able to connect to database!
A: Make sure that you have:
  * database running
  * installed PHP module for your database (like php5-pgsql)
  * installed MDB2 with PEAR
  * installed MDB2#driver_for_your_db (like MDB2_Driver_pgsql) 

NOTE: There is also a command line test script in /idacore/server/. You can use it by saying:
php cli_test.php
