TODO:

Graphical User Interface:
- rewriting using JQuery
- better time expressions 
- editor for editing templates
- drag&drop for attaching files to records
- more advanced search (current quicksearch only finds things that has appellation)


Server:
- CIDOC-CRM compatible mode (types are not presented as classes)
- file handling
- advanced search
- table editing
- translations for classes and types
- user privileges
- Properly login hash handling
- Paging for search results
- roles for participants



known issues:
- Quicksearch duplicates records if record has more than one appellation (for example appellation and object identifier)
- It is not possible to set empty value in the field that allready has a value (I think this should be done explicitly -> "clear this field")
- Class tree is not in alphabetical order
- It is possible to remove required value


CHANGES:
- added grouping to templates 5.3.2009
- smarter record load (group modifications, actions and parts earlier)15.3.2009
- simple place hierarchy getter 24.3.2009
